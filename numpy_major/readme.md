🎯 Objective
The NumPy Mathematical Calculator is a Python-based project designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the power of NumPy for numerical computing. This calculator performs basic arithmetic, statistical analysis, and array manipulation using NumPy arrays, providing a hands-on approach to learning array-based operations.

🧠 Project Description
This project demonstrates practical applications of NumPy in real-world numerical tasks. Users can perform arithmetic operations between arrays, analyze statistical properties of datasets, and manipulate arrays efficiently. The calculator serves as both a learning tool and a utility for numerical computations.

📋 Key Features

1.Basic Arithmetic Operations
-Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division between arrays
-Power operations for element-wise exponentiation
-Handles both scalar and array operations

2.Statistical Operations
-Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance
-Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Product
-Analysis of array properties: Shape, Size, Data Type

3.Array Manipulation
-Reshaping arrays (when dimensions allow)
-Sorting and reverse sorting arrays
-Extracting unique values
-Accessing first and last elements
-Filtering elements greater than the mean value

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Array creation
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
arr2 = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

Basic arithmetic
sum_arr = arr1 + arr2
product_arr = arr1 * arr2

Statistical operations
mean_val = np.mean(arr1)
std_val = np.std(arr2)

Array manipulation
reshaped = arr1.reshape(2, 2)
unique_vals = np.unique(np.array([1,2,2,3,3,3]))
